# Task 7: Fetch and Display Data from a Public API Using Fetch API

This project demonstrates how to use the JavaScript Fetch API to retrieve user data from a public API and display it dynamically on a webpage.

---

### **Objective**

- Fetch data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`.
- Display each user's name, email, and address.
- Handle errors gracefully.
- Allow reloading data with a button.

---

### **Tools**

- VS Code (or any text editor)
- Chrome Browser (or any modern browser)

---

###  **Features**

- Uses **Fetch API** to retrieve user data.  
- Displays data in **responsive user cards** arranged side by side.  
- Includes **hover effects** and **smooth animations** for interactivity.  
- A **reload button** to refetch data.  
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages.  
- Graceful fallback for **network errors** (test by going offline!).

---

### **Styling**

- Uses **flexbox** for layout.
- Smooth **hover animations** on cards and button.
- Clean, modern, and user-friendly design.

---

### **Key Concepts**

- **Fetch API** for asynchronous requests.
- **Promises** and **.then/.catch** handling.
- **JSON parsing** for API data.
- **Error handling** for reliable user experience.
- **Event listeners** for user interaction.
